# PalmROI
Implementation of Locating the ROI (Region Of Interest) of Palmprint for biometric Identification/Recognition using morphological image processing techniques.

This is the implementation of the paper that I submitted to the IEEE "PIC 2010" conference.
This paper was accepted. However, I did not register it.
My paper is included in the repository.
